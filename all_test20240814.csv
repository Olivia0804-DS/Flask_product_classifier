Calcium Citrate is designed to maintain your bone density and strengthen your bones. It is an effective preventative measure in fighting against health issues. Incorporate this kit into your diet today to start protecting your skeleton.SUPPORTS HEART HEALTH: Calcium also plays an important role in the contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscle tissues. Thus, adequate calcium intake is quite necessary to maintain cardiac health. Consult a doctor before use if you have a heart condition and are unsure if this supplement is right for you.BIOAVAILABLE INGREDIENTS: Calcium citrate’s common counterpart is calcium carbonate. Unlike citrate, carbonate neutralizes stomach acid and, therefore, is hard to digest, making our supplement the more effective and easier-to-absorb choice. With so many calcium supplements out there, it may be difficult to know which one to choose. That’s why we made ours from the best ingredients out there.BONE DENSITY AID: Apart from bone formation and reversing bone resorption, calcium also plays another role in maintaining bone health; it stabilizes and increases bone density. Bone density is one of the main factors contributing to your body’s resistance to bone injury and disease. You increase chances of avoiding broken bones and diseases like osteoporosis when you receive sufficient calcium.REJUVENATION THERAPEUTICS: At Rejuvenation Therapeutics, we aim to make proper nutrition and natural vegan supplements accessible to everyone who is looking into improving their health and lifestyle. It is our mission to create a world in which everyone is active, happy, and healthy for many years to come.
